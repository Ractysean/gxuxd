	Would it be ok if I took some of your time?
Would it be ok if I wrote you a rhyme?

Would it be ok if I opened my heart?

Amazing and beautiful,
not a flower or a tree.
Much prettier than that,
and only I can see.

I praise God for sending me you, my love.
I praise him for changing my view.
Now you are here with me, and I'm here with you.
Now will you let me love you?

Roses are red,
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet,
And I love you.

Anyone can tell you they love you.
Anyone can flatter you and tell you you're beautiful.
Anyone can make you smile and happy.
Anyone can promise you the world

You're the one I can't live without.
This fact is true, I have no doubt.
I love the way you smile at me.
I love the way together we're free.
